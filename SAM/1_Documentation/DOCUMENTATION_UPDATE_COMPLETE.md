## Next Steps

### Optional Cleanup

The `context.md` file still has old Phase H and I detailed content further down that could be cleaned up, but it's not critical since:
- The completed phases section at the top is correct
- The changelog has the details
- Separate completion docs exist

### Recommended

Leave as-is and focus on Phase J next. The docs are functional and accurate where it matters (top sections, changelog).
